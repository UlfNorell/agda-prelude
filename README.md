This is a programming library for Agda. This means that it contains almost no
proofs and it is not afraid to turn off the termination checker if it gets in
the way. If you are looking to formalize mathematics, this library is not for
you, but if you want to write programs in Agda this just might be what you are
looking for.

Note that this library is not compatible with the Agda standard library at
